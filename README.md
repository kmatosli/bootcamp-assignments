# Bootcamp Assignments

This repository contains coursework and module projects completed as part of a full-stack software engineering bootcamp.

## Organization

Assignments are grouped by topic and technology:

- `html-css/` – HTML, CSS, and responsive layout projects
- `javascript/` – DOM manipulation and API-driven applications
- `react/` – React applications ranging from fundamentals to advanced state management and CI/CD
- `python/` – Core Python, object-oriented programming, and CLI applications
- `databases/` – SQLAlchemy and relational database exercises
- `backend/` – Flask APIs, authentication, testing, and deployment projects

Each subfolder corresponds to a specific assignment or module project and includes its own README and source code.

## Important Note

This repository exists **solely for coursework and grading purposes**.

Employer-focused projects, production-quality systems, and long-term work are maintained in **separate, standalone repositories** and are linked from my portfolio site.
